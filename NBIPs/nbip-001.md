## Simple Summary
This proposal is a first step of reduce the per block reward from 35 to 17

## Abstract

As NBAI currently has only 1 billion in circulation, it takes about 12.96 seconds for the past 100,000 blocks
The 35 NBAI reward per block produces about 35*3600*24*365/12.966=85,127,255.90004627 per year, the inflation rate is about 0.085166 or 8.5166%
As NBAI cloud is not widely used yet, we would like to reduce the inflation rate lower than 5%, so if we reduce the reward to 17 NBAI per block , it will be 41366666 per year, the inflation rate will be 4% .

So we propose for this change to our community for discussion
